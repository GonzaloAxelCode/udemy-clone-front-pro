            In this course, youll learn how to create your own Slide Styles,
            Transitions and Templates in ProShow Producer 7. Youll learn how to
            create your own graphics that you may want to include in your
            designs and well also cover best practices for saving them,
            including labeling layers, identifying replaceable layers,
            categorizing your Styles and Transitions, and renaming individual
            slides in a Template. Youll also learn about the subtle, but
            important differences between linked layers and matched layers in a
            show template.

            Once youve started to create your own ProShow Designs, you may be
            ready to show them to the world, and maybe even make a little money
            on the side, by selling your designs on the Choice Slides
            Marketplace.
